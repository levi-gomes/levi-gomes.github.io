            Well, that&#39;s a stupid question, ins&#39;t it? This is a blog, what else would it be?
            Jokes aside, this is a blog mostly about gamedev - although I can&#39;t promise I won&#39;t write about anything else. I&#39;ll be making all sorts of posts, but one of the main focuses of this blog will be "Islands", the game I&#39;m currently working on. On those posts, I&#39;ll talk about what I&#39;ve been doing to the game, and I&#39;ll share some things I have learned doing it. By the way, the game isn&#39;t open source, but my aim is to write these posts as a deep dive into the mechanics of the game. For those of you who aren&#39;t interested in such technical information, you can just as well watch the short devlogs I&#39;ll be posting on YouTube alongside the posts in this blog. Also, I can&#39;t guarantee consistent posts, there might very well be periods of one to two months in which I don&#39;t post anything - or upload to YouTube - as I&#39;m still a student and of course school comes first. So I&#39;ll try to work on the game and make posts whenever I can, but no promises. Anyway, I hope you&#39;ll enjoy my posts and following along with the development of "Islands". Cheers!
